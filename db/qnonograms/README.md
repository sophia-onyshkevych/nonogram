These were taken from the `qnonograms` program's `Collections-may-2008.zip` file, offered on their project web site.  Since no copyright or license information was included, I've assumed they have the same copyright and license as the main `qnonograms` program.

These were taken from the `qnonograms` program source's `examples` directory.  None had explicit copyright or license information, so I assumed they were covered by the same copyright and license as the rest of `qnonograms`.
